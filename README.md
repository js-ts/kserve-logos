Hi everyone , I was looking to start contributing to kserve from today for that I've made 3 logos for kserve
They all are heptagons with 326CE5  and white text as their color with Helvetica font , the inspiration for this is drawn from the Kubernetes logo all logos are made in draw.io 
and also from 
<img width="1314" alt="kfserving" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79689323/131740246-1146e429-a0d1-43a8-862a-687e835fcd8b.png">

which is the most known picture of KF serving and it suggests KF serving is made upon istio , Knative and Kubernetes
